<em>"Khob'linn are small, black-hearted humanoids that lair in despoiled dungeons and other dismal settings. Individually weak, they gather in large numbers to torment other creatures."</em>

-- Taken from "The Races of the Spinwise Marches" by Scholar Av^urel Lor^kas, -13HE.

Traditionally the indentured servants of the UR'ku, the relationship between the Khob'linn and the UR'ku has evolved from a slave caste to if not equal, tehn at least approaching equal.
