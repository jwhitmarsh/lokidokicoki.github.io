Calendar


Since the advent of the Hylurian Empire, years are either negative or positive to show which side of the empire’s creation they fall.


216 days in 1 year, split into 6 ‘Siexta’ of 6 weeks of 6 days each. 


Each Siexta is associated with a deity and an associated celebration:


1st Siexta - Deep Winter - Althwinn


2nd Siexta - Enlightenment - Sibelius


3rd Siexta - Flowering - Rakshi


4th Siexta - Joy - Mendel


5th Siexta - Leaf fall - Grayfoot


6th Siexta - Reaping - KrayVax


An example date would be 402HE/DW28; the year 402, 28th day of Deep Winter (the date The Formal History of Hyluria was written).
